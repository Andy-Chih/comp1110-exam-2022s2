     * Given an array of integers and a start and end value, return the
     * the average of the array elements that are within the range from
     * start to end, inclusive; that is, the average of all values v in
     * the array such that start <= v <= end.
     *
     * Note that start and end are values, **not** array indices.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * If the array contains {20,1,5,2,33}, start is 5 and end is 40, the
     * average is (5 + 20 + 33) / 3 = 19.33333.
     *
     * If there are no values in the array that fall within the specified
     * range, the average is undefined; in this case the method should
     * return the end value.
     *
     * @param in    an array of integers.
     * @param start the start value of the range (inclusive).
     * @param end   the end value of the range (inclusive).
     * @return the average of the elements with value between start to end,
     *         or end if the average is undefined (no values within range).
