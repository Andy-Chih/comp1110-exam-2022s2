# COMP1110/6710/1140 final exam

This is a template for the final exam.

The final exam is scheduled for the 8th of November, starting from 9.30am.
Some students have clashing exams at this time; those students will be
given an alternate exam time.

The total exam time is 3 hours. Students who require extra writing time,
in accordance with their EAPs, will start the exam earlier. If you are
one of those students, you will be notified of the changed starting time
in advance.

A fork of the template repository will be set up on the exam server in
advance of the exam. During semester week 12, we will open up the server
so that you can *clone* your exam repository onto the computer that you
will use during the exam. We will then close access to the server, fill
your repository with content (exam questions) and open it up again at
the start of the exam. At the start of the exam, you must pull the
changes to update your local clone of the repository.

Remember that **what will be marked is what is in your repository on the
exam server when the exam ends**. You must commit and push your completed
work to the server or it will not be marked. Do not leave committing and
pushing to the last minute! We will not be providing any additional time
for late commits/pushes.
